# NodeJS & Mongodb API development

## What do we need

### [NodeJS](http://www.nodejs.org)

Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

### [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

npm is the package manager for JavaScript. Find, share, and reuse packages of code from hundreds of thousands of developers

### [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/)

MongoDB is an open-source document database that provides high performance, high availability, and automatic scaling.

### Editor

To write a website, app, API project, ... we need an editor. This can be a full blown IDE (integrated development environment), or a simple text editor. Most common editors to date are Sublime Text 2, Atom, Visual Code, Vim, WebStorm, ...

### GIT

We use the power of GIT to store our code, not only for safekeeping and backups but also to make it easy to jump around in our code. Working on features, untill they are finished but still giving us the power to jump back to different versions of our project without having to copy our project folder 10 times over.

### Some commandline

For many things we find UI apps, GIT, Build tools, ... But working with JavaScript and NodeJS these days you will not escape the commandline. Don't worry it won't bite! We'll explain every step along the way.

## About this project

We divide the project into several chapters, each one building upon the previous chapter. Each chapter is tagged in GIT with the following name `chapter-X` where `X` is the chapter number.

So if you want to quickly view a specific chapter, you can check it out by openning the commandline in the root of this API project and use the following command `git checkout chapter-X` (again, replace `X` with the chapter's number).

If you want to start working with a specific chapter you can always branch of into a new featurebranch from a certain chapter tag by using the following command `git checkout -b <my-branch-name> chapter-X` (you get the idea by now, substitude `X` with the chapter number, and `<my branch-name>` with the name you want your branch to be.)

## Next

Start of with [Chapter 1](./chapter-1.md)
